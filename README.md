   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehediHasan-ds/WebDev-Projects.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:

## 🧩 How It Works

### 1. **Fetching Products**
   - The `script.js` file fetches product data from the `products.json` file using the `fetch` API.
   - Products are dynamically rendered on the page using JavaScript.

### 2. **Adding to Cart**
   - When a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, the product is added to the cart.
   - The cart is stored in `localStorage`, so it persists even after refreshing the page.

### 3. **Updating the Cart**
   - Users can increase or decrease the quantity of items in the cart.
   - The total price is automatically calculated and displayed.

### 4. **Clearing the Cart**
   - Users can clear the entire cart by clicking the "Clear Cart" button.

### 5. **Interactive UI**
   - A fixed "View Cart" button is always visible for easy access.
   - A modal displays the cart contents, and users can close it by clicking outside the modal or the close button.

## 🎨 Styling Highlights

- **Responsive Design**: The product grid adjusts based on screen size.
- **Hover Effects**: Product cards lift and cast a shadow when hovered.
- **Animations**: Smooth slide-in and fade-out animations for the "Add to Cart" message.
- **Fixed Cart Button**: The "View Cart" button is fixed at the bottom-right corner for easy access.
